# calibration_case_study
For the purpose of showing the calibration process of the Bayesian inference in gravitational wave astronomy.

Here, we demonstrate the process of "correcting" the Bayesian credible interval for a 1d toy model in the paper[paper_link]. \n

Starting from the simulation for the training set, going through the training process, and testing the proposed model at the test signal d_{o} (the test signal is generated without noise), the calibrated region at a nominal level of 80% is obtained and displayed in the plot. The results are slightly different from the paper as different seed is used here.
